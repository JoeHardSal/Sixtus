Artificial Inteligence
Hi, I'm Sixtus! I am an artificial intelligence capable of performing multiple tasks,
at the level of monitoring and reporting. My automatic systems detect availability of 
equipment in the network, as well as generation of alerts so that they are sent to the 
team via whatsapp, mail, graphic alerts, and my automated voice in the operator room, 
All this in real time. My voice is very beautiful, although sometimes my volume may be 
a little high, but it is in order to alert my fellows :) 
I consider myself one more operator and although I am not of flesh and blood with my 
automatic tools I can help in the diagnosis of problems and most importantly, "Prevent them"

My creator Joel Saldana, made me respecting the basic principles of respect, commitment, 
honesty and punctuality, for this all my possibilities for growth and improvements have 
no limit. Soon you will know much more about me ...
